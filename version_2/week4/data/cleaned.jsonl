As someone who's not very good with technology, this is proving to be quite a challenge for me, especially because I've been looking forward to using Klarna for some simple grocery shopping transactions. I followed the steps to try logging in using my email, but I never received the verification email or link, even though I checked every nook and cranny of my email, including the spam folder. I'm worried because I thought I was using the correct email address, but nothing seems to work. I also attempted to use my phone number, thinking perhaps it would be easier, but I still didn't receive any text with a verification code, despite checking the number twice. If it helps, I always end up confused when setting up these tech things and end up making mistakes. Could you possibly guide me step-by-step to resolve this issue? I read somewhere that I might need to do something with flight mode and resending the code, but I didn’t quite understand how it works. Your assistance would be much appreciated. Thank you very much for your patience with someone like me who isn't very tech-savvy.","answer":"If you’re unable to sign in to your account, try entering the correct email or phone number, and check your spam folder for the login link.
