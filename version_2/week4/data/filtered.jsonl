Credit assessment: Other credit factors are also considered in determining your payment plan options.\n\nIt's important to note that our Customer Service team cannot manually increase your spending limit or provide detailed information about the automated assessment.\n\nTo avoid this situation in the future, you can:\n1. Check your current purchase power before making a purchase.\n2. Ensure the total order amount is within your purchase power if you prefer 4 equal payments.\n3.

{"citation": "The question is based on the provided context about Klarna's automated approval assessment and credit score impact.", "question": "Hey Klarna! I'm so excited to finally try out your service, but I'm honestly super frustrated and confused right now. I just tried to make my first purchase using Klarna, and it got declined out of nowhere! \ud83d\ude20", "answer": "I completely understand your frustration and excitement about trying Klarna for the first time. I'm sorry to hear that your first experience wasn't smooth. Let me explain how our system works and address your concerns.\n\nFirstly, I want to assure you that being declined for a purchase with Klarna does not impact your credit score. We perform a soft credit check which doesn't affect your credit score at all.\n\nOur approval process is automated and happens in real-time for each purchase attempt. This means that even if you have great credit, the decision can vary based on multiple factors that are assessed at the moment of purchase. These factors include:\n\n1. Your Klarna payment history (which you don't have yet as a new user)\n2. Information from credit bureaus about your credit history\n3. Your current outstanding debts\n4. The specific details of the purchase you're trying to make\n\nThe reason we do this for each purchase is to help our customers balance debt risk and stay on top of their spending. It's not about judging your overall creditworthiness, but rather assessing the risk of this particular transaction at this particular time.\n\nWhile we don't look at your entire credit history for every purchase, we do use the most up-to-date information available to make our decision. This helps protect both you and Klarna from potential financial risks.\n\nIf you were declined, I encourage you to:\n1. Check the pop-up message for any specific instructions\n2. Ensure all your personal information is accurate\n3. Try again later, as our automated system reassesses with each attempt\n\nRemember, one decline doesn't mean you'll always be declined. Many customers are approved on subsequent attempts.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify how our system works. We truly appreciate your interest in using Klarna, and we hope you'll give it another try. If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask!", "category": "Declined purchase", "subcategory": "Declined Purchase"}
