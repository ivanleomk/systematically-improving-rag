# What happens if my purchase is for a different amount than the One-time card?

**In case of a higher purchase amount**  
You must cancel the One\-time card and then create a new One\-time card for the full purchase amount.

**In case of a lower purchase amount**  
No worries – you’ll only be billed for what you end up using, including the service fee. When you are sure your whole order has been processed, [log in](https://app.klarna.com/login/) and select **Refund unused amount**. If you don’t use the option in the app, Klarna will automatically adjust the plan after 14 days.

*Good to know:* The authorization hold placed on your payment card will be removed. This can take between 1 to 7 days depending on your bank.
