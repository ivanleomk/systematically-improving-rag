# How can I change my email address?

Chat with our Customer Service to change your email address for your active payment plan.  
We’ll email a verification code to your new email address to confirm the change.

**What happens next?**  
When logging in with the new email address, you will now see the purchases connected to that email address in your Klarna account. Use the new email address to place future purchases and to keep and manage all your payments in one Klarna account.

If you have an active membership or subscription update the store about your new email address.

*Good to know:*

* Use the updated email address when logging in for an overview of your purchases connected to that email address
* The email address for paid purchases or processing purchases can’t be changed
* The new email address will be used by Klarna when evaluating eligibility and to autofill when shopping with us
