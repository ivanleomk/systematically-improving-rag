# How much am I eligible to spend?

There is no predefined spending limit when using Klarna. Instead, a new automated approval decision about how much you can spend with us is made each time you pay with Klarna.

#### To see your estimated amount to spend:

1. [Log in](https://app.klarna.com/login?auto-login&market=us&utm_campaign=customer-service-faq&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=klarna) to the app
2. Navigate to **Purchase power**
3. Follow the prompts to check the estimated amount you can spend on your next purchase

Your Purchase power is an estimated amount based on factors such as your payment history with Klarna and your outstanding balance. The amount is not a guarantee and may change based on the store and payment option you choose.

**Good to know:** If you are using the [Shopping extension on your browser](https://www.klarna.com/us/browser-extension/) you can see your estimated purchase power when creating a One\-time card.

#### I want to increase my Purchase power

A good payment history, always paying on time and making payments towards your outstanding purchases can increase your Purchase power over time. Our Customer Service can’t accept requests for spending limit increases.

#### My Purchase power is $0

If you’ve spent above your purchase power, then your purchase power will be $0\. Making payments towards your outstanding purchases can increase your Purchase Power.

#### My Purchase power is not available

If you have overdue or failed payments, then your Purchase power will not be available. To increase your chance of approval to shop with Klarna, and view your Purchase power in the app, settle your failed or overdue payments
