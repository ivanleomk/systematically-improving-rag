# Why do I need to verify my details when paying?

We ask you to verify your details to ensure your information, and purchases associated with your email address, are shared securely.

#### These are the ways by which we can verify your details:

* We’ll send you a verification code by email to verify your email address
* We’ll send you a verification code via SMS to verify your phone number
* We’ll ask you to log into your bank to verify your identity
* We will ask you to upload a photo ID together with a selfie

#### What is PSD2?

The Second EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2\) makes online payments more secure by requiring a stronger customer authentication procedure (SCA). Because of the directive, you need to confirm your payment with a second authentication step (two\-factor authentication). For example with a fingerprint in the online banking app or an additional verification code.
