# Why was the investigation of my problem closed, even though my problem has not been solved yet?

There can be different reasons why the investigation of your problem was closed, even though your problem isn’t solved.

The most common reasons are:

* **You didn’t provide valid information to support the investigation of your problem**  
If we contacted you for more information regarding your problem but didn’t receive valid information, the investigation will have been closed and your payments no longer paused.
* **The store registered a refund**  
If the store registered a refund for your purchase the investigation of the problem will have closed automatically and your payments no longer paused. If the refund registered by the store is not correct, please contact the store to find a solution.
* **The store informed us that the statement is correct and/or that the problem is invalid**  
If the store confirmed that the statement was correct or that the problem was deemed invalid, the investigation of the issue will have been closed and your payments no longer paused.
* **You have resolved your issue**  
If you’ve resolved your issue in the Klarna app, the investigation of your problem will have been closed and your payments no longer paused. Please note that the option to report a problem won’t be available any longer. If your problem is not solved, please contact the store to find a solution.

**Can I report a problem again?**  
It’s not possible to report a problem for the same purchase again, but we have extended your due date to give you more time to solve the issue together with the store.

If the due date is approaching and you haven’t been able to solve the problem with the store, you can gather all the information regarding your problem and [chat](https://app.klarna.com/support) with our Customer Service.
