# Why are not all payment methods available at the checkout?

Klarna does not approve all orders for all our payment options and our aim is to support responsible, ethical, and sensible spending habits. Although our payment options are widely promoted they are not always universally available. We understand that it can be frustrating to not be able to choose the payment option you prefer. However, our approval process helps Klarna responsibly offer our services to our customers. Please understand that our Customer Service is not able to influence which payment options are available to you.

There are a number of factors, including address details, cardholder details, amount of order, the online store, previous order history, that are taken into consideration to determine which payment methods are offered. Some stores that offer Klarna donâ€™t offer all payment options. Even if the store offers your preferred payment options with Klarna, it may not be available for all products and purchases. At the time of your purchase, all available payment options will be presented at checkout.

**Good to know**: Each purchase is a new decision so in the future, your preferred payment option might be available to you again.
