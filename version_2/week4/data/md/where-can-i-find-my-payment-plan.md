# Where can I find my payment plan?

**To view all your payment plans:**

1. Go to [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/to-do/to-pay/) to see your orders
2. Select an order to view your payment plan

We’ll also send you an email with the payment plan when the store ships your order. If you don’t see an email from Klarna in your inbox, make sure to check your spam folder as well.

**I still can’t find my payment plan**

If you don’t see the order you are looking for in the app:

* Verify you logged in with the same email address you used to place the order
* Check you received the confirmation email from the store and log in with that linked email
* [Chat](https://app.klarna.com/support/) with our customer service to change the email address connected to the order

We recommend always using the same email address when shopping with Klarna.

*Good to know:* If you place an order by signing up with **Apple ID** with a hidden email address you won’t be able to see the order in the app as it is linked to a random email address. Chat with our Customer Service to change the email address linked to the order.
