# How can I merge my Klarna accounts?

If you wish to manage all your payments in one Klarna account, chat with our Customer Service to see if it’s possible to connect your order to your preferred email address.

*Good to know:* Always use the same email address when shopping with Klarna to avoid creating multiple Klarna accounts – it’ll make life easier next time you are looking for your purchase and payments details.
