# When will I receive my Klarna Card refund?

Your refund is processed as soon as we receive the refund or cancellation confirmation from the store. It can then take up to 14 days for the funds to clear and your connected bank account balance to update.

*Good to know:*

* The amount is refunded to your connected bank account.
* If we are unable to match your refund to an order, the unmatched refund will be added to the next statement as a credit.
