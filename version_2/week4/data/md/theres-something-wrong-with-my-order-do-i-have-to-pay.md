# There’s something wrong with my order. Do I have to pay?

No, you do not need to pay for items that you did not order, are faulty, or broken. Please contact the store to let them know you received the wrong order and follow their instructions.

**Let us know if there’s something wrong with your order:**

1. **Go to**[**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/)and select the order you want to cancel
2. Tap **Report a problem**
3. Select the option that suits you best and follow the instruction to pause your payments

By doing this, your payment plan will be paused until you’ve resolved the issue with the store. You can [check the status](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna) of your reported problem on the details page of your purchase.

**Good to know:** Keep an eye on your email inbox as we may contact you after 21 days to request additional information.
