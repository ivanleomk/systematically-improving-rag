# Why is my debt in collection?

If your payment is not registered by the last reminder due date, the debt is transferred to debt collection.

#### Can I still pay Klarna directly?

Yes, you are welcome to pay either directly to Klarna or the collection agency. Your outstanding balance will be updated in any case.

#### To settle your balance through Klarna:

1. Go to [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/to-do/to-pay/)
2. Choose the purchase you would like to pay
3. Tap **Payment options** and follow the instructions

Any questions regarding fees added for the collection of debt should be directed to the debt collection agency. You can find contact information for the collection agency printed on your debt collection letter.

*Good to know:* If a payment is late, you will not be able to continue using Klarna until you’ve paid off your debt. Late payments might also be reported to the credit bureaus.
