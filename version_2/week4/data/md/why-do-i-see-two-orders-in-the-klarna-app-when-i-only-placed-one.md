# Why do I see two orders in the app when I only placed one?

Orders can sometimes be split because the order was shipped separately. Each shipment is then listed in the app as a separate order.

A separate payment plan is then generated for each shipment to ensure you are not charged for items that have not yet been shipped.

The total number of payment plans generated for the split order will never exceed the original purchase amount of the order.

But should you have been charged for something you have not purchased, or appear to be charged the wrong amount, let us know by reporting the problem:

1. Go to [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/)
2. Select the purchase in question
3. Tap **Report a problem**

You will receive an email from us while your payments are paused. [Log in](https://app.klarna.com/login?auto-login&market=us&utm_campaign=customer-service-faq&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=klarna)  for payment information and updates about your reported problem.
