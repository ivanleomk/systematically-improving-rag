# My problem has been solved, what should I do?

If your problem was solved, you can easily resolve your issue in the Klarna app. If you report your problem as solved, it’s important to be aware that a problem can’t be reported again. Resolving your issue tells us that the problem has been resolved to your satisfaction.

**To report your problem as solved:**

1. Go to [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/)
2. Choose the purchase you want to update
3. Select **Problem solved** at the bottom of the page

We will automatically close the investigation and update your payment plan. If any payments are still outstanding for that purchase, you can resume your payment by [logging in](https://app.klarna.com/to-do/to-pay/).
