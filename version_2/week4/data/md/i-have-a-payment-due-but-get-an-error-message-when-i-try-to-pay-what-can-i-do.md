# I have a payment due, but get an error message when I try to pay, what can I do?

Follow these troubleshooting tips if your due payment failed when you tried to pay:

#### Invalid card

First, check if your connected card has expired or if it has been blocked or frozen. Log in to the app to update or change your connected card details:

1. Tap [**Purchases**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/)
2. Select your order
3. Choose **Change card**
#### Technical error

If you encountered an error message when trying to make a payment in the app take a moment to:

* Check you’re using the latest version of the app
* Clear cookies in your browser
* Be sure you’re not using a limited or restricted network (such as a work connection)
* Check you have sufficient funds available to cover the payment
#### Failed two\-factor authentication

If your card issuer has requested you authenticate your identity for a Klarna payment, be sure to follow the prompts which redirect you to approve the payment.

If you don’t follow the two\-factor authentication prompts you will receive an error message and be unable to complete the purchase – so try placing the order again but follow the prompts.

#### Insufficient funds

If we are unable to collect the payment on the scheduled date, we will try again. So please ensure your connected card is up to date and there are enough funds available for the scheduled payment.

*Good to know:* If your payment fails, you’ll be sent an email with information on how to resume payment.
