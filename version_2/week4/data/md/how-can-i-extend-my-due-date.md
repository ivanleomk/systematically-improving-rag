# How can I extend my due date?

Log in to the app to extend your due date. If the option to extend your due date is available it will be offered:

1. Go to [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/to-do/to-pay/)
2. Select the order you would like to pay later
3. Tap **Options** and then tap **Extend due date**

If you postpone your due date any upcoming payments for this order will be rescheduled to be withdrawn biweekly from the new payment date. You can see updated payment plans in the app by tapping **Show plan** on the order page.

*Good to know:*You can extend your due date once per order.
