# How can I get approved to pay with Klarna?

Follow the instructions in the pop\-up message which appeared at checkout before attempting to make another purchase, if you are not approved to pay with Klarna.

Our automated approval decisions are based on the available customer data, primarily shared by credit bureaus, including information such as if you’ve paid off previous credits on time, or if you have too much outstanding debt elsewhere.

#### I’ve used Klarna before but have been declined

Each purchase attempt generates a new automated approval decision, which is based on [current credit data](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/why-was-my-purchase-not-approved-with-klarna/), regardless of past approvals or rejections. A rejection does not negatively impact your credit score.

*Good to know:* Our customer service agents do not have additional information about the automated decline reason, based on credit bureau decision data, and are not able to change or influence the decision.

#### Can I make multiple purchases with Klarna?

Yes. There is no set limit for how many purchases you can have with Klarna.
