# How do I return my order?

Follow the store’s return instructions and then let us know which items you have returned by reporting a return in the app:

1. Go to [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/)
2. Select the purchase, or the items, you wish to return
3. Tap **Report return**

Heads up, if you later wish to return more items than you initially reported in the app, be sure to let the store know so your order details can be updated by the store.

#### Save the tracking information

Submit the information at any time in the [app](https://app.klarna.com/login) – follow the prompts to enter the tracking details \& the date you made the return. If after 21 days your return is not registered correctly by the store we can always support you if you provided the required returns information.

And always be sure to keep copies of your correspondence or proof of your attempts to contact the store.

#### Goods ordered online returned to the physical store

If you have returned goods ordered online to the physical store keep proof of the return until your return has been registered.

#### Check the the app for updates

Once the store has adjusted your payment plan we will notify you, and send an email, with the new balance. [How your refund will be processed](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/how-long-do-refunds-take/) depends on the payment method you used. If you have any questions regarding the status of your return or refund eligibility contact the store directly.

*Good to know:* if you receive store credit, for example a gift card, your payments to Klarna are still due. Please note that Klarna manages your payment while the store is responsible for all other aspects concerning your order.
