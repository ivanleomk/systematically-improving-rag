# When will my order be delivered?

Deliveries are subject to the store’s delivery services, so please check the store’s website for information on their shipping policies. Use the tracking number provided by the store for updates on the estimated delivery date.

When your order is processed, you’ll receive an email with the tracking and shipping details of your order. If you don’t receive any shipping confirmation, please contact the store to get updates on your delivery.

*Good to know:* After you place an order on the store’s website, it may take a few days for the store to process your order. If you’d like to know the current status of your order, please contact the store directly.

#### Are you still waiting for your order?

If your order doesn’t arrive, please let us know before the payment deadline expires by [logging in](https://app.klarna.com/login?auto-login&market=us&utm_campaign=customer-service-faq&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=klarna) to the app. Choose the purchase you’re still waiting to be delivered and select **Report a problem**. As soon as you’ve reported your problem, your payment plan is paused. This gives you extra time to find a solution with the store.
