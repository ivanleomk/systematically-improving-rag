# What should I do if the store doesn’t respond?

If you have contacted the store to solve your problem but haven’t had any success, you can inform us about your issue by [reporting a problem](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/) for the order.

As soon as you’ve reported your problem your payments are paused. This gives you extra time to find a solution with the store. Ensure to save all relevant documentation. For us to be able to support you, you must provide us with necessary information upon request.

**Good to know:** Keep an eye on your email inbox as we may contact you after 21 days to request additional information.
