# What if I never use the One-time card and want to cancel it?

The One\-time card will expire if you don’t use it at the store’s checkout within 24 hours after it’s created. You can also cancel the One\-time card instantly if it’s no longer needed. When either of these actions occurs, we will cancel any payment plan you might have, including the service fee.

**To cancel an unused One\-time card:**

1. Go to [**Wallet**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/)
2. Select the card or payment plan you want to cancel
3. Tap **Cancel this card**

**Good to know:**If you want to make another purchase, just create a new card and keep on shopping.
