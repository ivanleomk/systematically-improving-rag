# I don’t recognize a charge, what should I do?

If you receive an email or see a charge linked to Klarna that you don’t recognize, report the unauthorized charge to us.

#### Before reporting a charge as unauthorized, first, check that:

* You are the only person in your household who has used your account to shop
* You did not select Klarna at the checkout on a store’s website without noticing
* You did not receive an order confirmation or email from Klarna on or around the date of the purchase
* It‘s not a charge for a previous order that has been billed separately
* It’s not a possible authorization hold for a pending purchase

If you still do not recognize this Klarna purchase and you believe you may be a victim of identity theft, report it to us directly in the app or by [contacting](https://app.klarna.com/support/) our customer service.
