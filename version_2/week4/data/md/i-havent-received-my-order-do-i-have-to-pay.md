# I haven’t received my order. Do I have to pay?

No, you do not need to pay for your order until you have received all your purchased items.

If you haven’t yet received your order and the due date is approaching, we kindly ask you to do the following to avoid any fees:

1. **Track your delivery**  
Use the tracking number provided by the store for updates on your order’s estimated delivery date.
2. **Contact the store**  
If no shipping information is available or your delivery is delayed, please contact the store directly. Only the store is able to help you locate your delivery or potentially replace your purchase if it got lost in the mail.
3. **Let us know you haven’t received your order**  
While you’re trying to find a solution with the store, make sure that you don’t miss any payments by [logging in](https://app.klarna.com/login?auto-login&market=us&utm_campaign=customer-service-faq&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=klarna) and letting us know you are still waiting for your delivery. Choose the purchase you’re still waiting to be delivered and select **Report a problem**.
4. **Check the app for updates**  
As soon as you’ve reported your problem, your payment plan will be paused until you’ve found a solution with the store. Your payment plan will be updated accordingly when the store updates your order.
5. **Keep an eye on your email and notifications**  
If no updates have been made to your payment plan and you still haven’t received your order, you will be asked to provide additional information so we can support you and start an investigation. It’s important that you save all relevant documentation until the issue is resolved.

*Good to know:* Please also follow the steps above if you’ve only received part of your order.
