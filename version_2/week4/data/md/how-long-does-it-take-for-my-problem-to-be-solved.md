# How long does it take for my problem to be solved?

The quickest way for you to resolve your problem is to find a solution together with the store. Please contact the store directly so they can update your payment plan accordingly. If you are unable to resolve your problem with the store after 21 days, we will ask you to provide us with more information so we can investigate further.

Once Klarna starts the review, resolution time usually ranges between 20 – 50 days, hence we recommend resolving the issue together with the store even after you’ve reported your problem to us.
