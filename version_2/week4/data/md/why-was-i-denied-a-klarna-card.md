# Why was I denied a Klarna Card?

There can be different reasons why you were denied when applying for a Klarna Card.

To be eligible for a Klarna card, you must:

* Be at least 18 years old
* Must have paid with Klarna at least once before
* Have a good credit history

*Please note:* [A credit check will be performed](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/klarna-perform-credit-check/) when applying for a Klarna Card. If your application is denied due to your current credit score, youâ€™re welcome to apply again in the future.

**What can I do?**
