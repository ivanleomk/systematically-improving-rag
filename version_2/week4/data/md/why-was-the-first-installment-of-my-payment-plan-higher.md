# Why was the first installment of my payment plan higher?

If Pay in 4 equal payments is not available, you may be offered an alternative Pay in 4 payment option with a higher first installment, instead of 4 equal payments.

This can happen because the order amount exceeded your purchase power, however, other credit factors are also assessed.

Purchase power is the estimated amount available to spend using Klarna’s pay later products. Your spending limit and any outstanding balances are factored into the purchase power amount.

*Good to know:*

* Our Customer Service is not able to increase your spending limit nor has further information about the automated assessment.
* When selecting 4 bi\-weekly payments as your payment plan on One\-time cards, there is a service fee charged alongside the first payment.
#### What’s next?

* If you would prefer a payment plan of 4 equal payments always ensure the total order amount is within your purchase power.
* If the order amount exceeds either your spending limit, or the estimated purchase power, and you are offered an adjusted payment plan with a higher first installment amount – accept the offer in the checkout.
