# What happens when I report a return?

As soon as you’ve reported your return your invoice is paused. This allows time for the return to be registered by the store and your invoice to be updated accordingly. You will receive an email with updated payment information or you can always log in to the [app](https://app.klarna.com/login) for up\-to\-date payment details.

Contact the store directly if your return is not registered correctly, as only they can adjust your remaining balance. Keep in mind that Klarna manages your payment while the store is responsible for all other aspects concerning your order.

Submit the returns information at any time in the [app](https://app.klarna.com/login) – follow the prompts to enter the tracking details \& the date you made the return. If after 21 days your return is not registered correctly by the store we can always support you if you’ve provided the required returns information.

And always be sure to keep copies of your correspondence or proof of your attempts to contact the store.
