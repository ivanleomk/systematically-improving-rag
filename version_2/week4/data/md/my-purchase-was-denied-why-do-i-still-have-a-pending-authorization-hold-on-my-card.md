# My purchase was denied, why do I still have a pending authorization hold on my card?

The transaction on your payment card is an authorization hold, which is released within 24 hours if the Pay in 4 purchase is declined.

*Good to know:* When the hold is released your account balance will update automatically. Depending on your financial institution, it can take between 1 to 7 business days for this to reflect on your account balance.

In the case that you receive a payment plan for a failed or canceled purchase, it could be due to the store not canceling the order in their system. Contact the store to cancel the order. If the store is unable to cancel the order, [contact us](https://app.klarna.com/login) with the cancellation confirmation to hand.
