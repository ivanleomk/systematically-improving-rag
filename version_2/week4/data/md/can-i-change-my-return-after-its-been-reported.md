# Can I change my return after it’s been reported?

It’s not possible to change the information submitted after reporting the return to us. But don’t worry, you’ll only have to pay for the items that you keep.

#### I want to return more/fewer items

If you’ve changed your mind and you want to return more, or fewer, items than you originally reported, inform the store directly as only they can update your payment plan. Please check the store’s website for information on their return policy and instructions on how to make changes to your return.

Once the store has registered your return, your payment plan will be adjusted accordingly, and we’ll notify you and send you an email with the updated payment plan.

#### I want to cancel the return

If you no longer want to return your order, you can cancel the reported return in the Klarna app by following the steps below.

**To cancel your return:**

1. Go to [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/)
2. Select the purchase you want to update
3. Tap **Cancel return**

If an outstanding amount is due after canceling the return, you can make a payment by [logging in.](https://app.klarna.com/to-do/to-pay/)

*Good to know:* Once you’ve canceled your return, you will not be able to report a return for the same purchase again.

#### I’ve accidentally canceled my return

Once you’ve canceled your return, you will not be able to report a return to us again for the same purchase. If you have canceled your return in error, contact the store directly to adjust your payment plan.
