# How can I avoid late fees?

To ensure you never miss a payment and avoid late fees:

#### Enable payment notifications:

1. Go to [**Settings**](https://app.klarna.com/you/)
2. Navigate to **Notifications**
3. Find **Purchases and payments**
4. Tap the toggle to turn on **Payment due notifications**

If you haven’t received your order, or have returned it to the store, report it to pause your invoice.
