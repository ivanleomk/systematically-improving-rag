# Does Klarna perform a credit check and will this affect my credit score?

Klarna evaluates your ability to pay by assessing available data to ensure responsible lending.

When a credit check is performed, we verify your identity using the details you provided and we look at information from your credit report to understand your financial behavior and evaluate your creditworthiness.

We will **not** perform a credit check when:

* Signing up to use Klarna
* Downloading the [app](https://www.klarna.com/us/klarna-app/)

We will perform a soft credit check when you:

* Use [Pay in 4](https://www.klarna.com/us/pay-in-4/)
* Use [Pay in 30 days](https://cdn.klarna.com/1.0/shared/content/legal/terms/0/en_us/invoice?_gl=1*y50jvt*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2Mzk5OTg2NTIuQ2owS0NRaUE4SUNPQmhEbUFSSXNBRUdJNm8xcVUwX0oxM2VfTkRfemR0WW9va2tMaFFzdzNJTHN6clpadV9ab1hUNmpJX2tCRnhPQUNqc2FBa251RUFMd193Y0I.)
* Use [Monthly financing](https://www.klarna.com/us/legal/)
* Apply for a [Klarna Card](https://www.klarna.com/us/klarna-card/)

Soft credit checks do not affect your credit score and will not be visible to other lenders.  
  
**Good to know**: If you make late payments or fail to pay, this could have a negative impact on your creditworthiness and prevent you from using our payment methods.

Our third party credit checks are performed by [Transunion](https://www.transunion.com/). If you have questions regarding their services, your credit score, or the data provided as part of a credit check we advise you to reach out to them directly.

These checks are performed in accordance with [Klarnaâ€™s Terms \& Conditions](https://www.klarna.com/us/legal/).
