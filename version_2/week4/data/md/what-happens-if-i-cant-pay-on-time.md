# What happens if I canâ€™t pay on time?

If we are unable to collect the payment on the scheduled date, we will try again. If that payment attempt also fails the missed payment will be added to the amount of the next scheduled payment. Late fees may also apply. Please check the terms and conditions of your order for details.

**Good to know**: Missed payments and unpaid debts are sent to debt collection.

#### Need a few extra days?

You can extend your next payment date once per order:

1. Go to [**Purchases**](https://app.klarna.com/to-do/to-pay/)
2. Select the order you would like to pay later
3. Tap **Manage payments** and then tap **Extend due date**

**Good to know:** It is not possible to extend the due date for purchases placed with Financing.

If you are struggling to make a payment or experiencing unexpected financial hardship [contact us](#cs-contact-details) \- we are here to help.
