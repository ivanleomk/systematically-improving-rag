# My order was cancelled, why am I still being charged?

If it appears that you are still being charged, even though the order is canceled, it is most likely due to the store not releasing the authorization hold.

**What is an authorization hold?**

* An authorization hold is an amount placed on your card to ensure enough funds are available for your first payment.
* The hold is released by the store when the order is canceled.
* Depending on your financial institution, the release will be reflected in your bank account between 1 to 7 business days.

**What should I do?**  
If you are still being charged, or the authorization hold has not been released after a couple of days, we recommend [chatting](https://app.klarna.com/support/) with our Customer Service with your cancelation confirmation on hand.
