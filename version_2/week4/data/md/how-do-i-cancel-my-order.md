# How do I cancel my order?

To cancel your order, follow these steps:

1. **Contact the store**  
Contact the store directly to cancel your order. Always follow the store’s cancellation policy. As the payment provider, we can’t cancel your order.
2. **Wait for the store’s confirmation**  
We will cancel your payment accordingly and refund any paid amount when the store confirms the cancellation.
3. **Check for updates in the Klarna app**  
You can check the status of your order anytime under [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/) in the Klarna app.
4. **Receive refund**  
[Refund processing times](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/how-long-do-refunds-take/) vary and can take up to 14 days, depending on your financial institution. If 14 days have passed since the store confirmed your cancellation and you’re still missing your refund, please [chat](https://app.klarna.com/support/) with our Customer Service with your cancellation confirmation available.
