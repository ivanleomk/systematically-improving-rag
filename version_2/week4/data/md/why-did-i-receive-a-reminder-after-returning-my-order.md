# Why did I receive a reminder after returning my order?

If the payment due date has passed but the return (or payment) has not been registered, you will receive a reminder. It can happen that the reminder was sent while your return was in transit or was still processing.

If you have returned your order but still received a reminder, please let us know that you’re waiting for the return to be registered by reporting your return.

**To report your return:**

1. Go to [**Payments**](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/)
2. Select the purchase you want to return
3. Tap **Report return** and follow the instruction to pause your invoice

Once you have reported your return, your invoice will be paused until your return is registered. Your invoice will be adjusted when the store updates your order.
