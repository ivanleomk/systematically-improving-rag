# Why was my purchase not approved with Klarna?

The reason is displayed in a pop\-up message, which appears at checkout, if you are not approved to pay with Klarna. Be sure to follow the instructions in the pop\-up message before attempting to make another purchase.

We understand it can be frustrating if Klarna’s payment options are not available when making a purchase – especially having been approved in the past. Different factors are being assessed in real time to help our customers balance debt risk and stay on top of their spending. Rest assured, declined purchases do not impact your [credit score](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/does-klarna-affect-my-credit-score/).

*Good to know:* Common data points typically considered in automated approval decisions for Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services include:

* Credit score
* Income
* Employment stability
* Spending patterns
* Debt\-to\-income ratio
* Residential status
* Identity and age verification
* Credit history
* Affordability assessment
* Savings and investments
* Outstanding credit

Note, each purchase generates a new automated approval assessment so one rejection does not mean that your future purchases will also be declined.

Our customer service agents do not have additional information about the automated decline reason, based on credit bureau decision data, and are not able to change or influence the decision.
