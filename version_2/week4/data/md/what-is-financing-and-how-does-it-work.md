# What is Financing and how does it work?

Financing allows you to spread the cost of your purchase for up to 24 months.

#### How to finance your purchase:

1. Select the Financing option in the store’s checkout
2. Choose your preferred timeline and agreed interest rate
3. Follow the steps to complete the application
4. Get an instant approval decision
5. Complete your purchase

You’ll receive an email from us with your payment plan when the store ships your order.

*Please note:* [A credit check will be performed](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/klarna-perform-credit-check/) when you apply for our Financing options.

#### When do I pay?

Your first Financing payment is due one month after the store processes your order and then monthly thereafter on the same date each month until your statement is fully paid.
