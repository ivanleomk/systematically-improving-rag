# How long do refunds take?

It can take up to 14 days for refunds to process and the balance of your connected payment method to update. 

* The refund process starts as soon as we receive [return](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/csc/delivery-returns/returns/) confirmation from the store.
* [Log in](https://app.klarna.com/login) to check the store has received your return or [canceled](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/csc/delivery-returns/cancellations/) your order.

You’ll receive an email and an [app](https://app.klarna.com/login/) notification with updated refund information. Any remaining payments will be canceled. 

**Did you return or cancel part of your order?**

In this case, we will issue a partial refund:

* If the partial refund is **less** than the remaining balance of your order, the amount still owed will be spread evenly across the remaining payments.
* If the partial refund is **greater** than the remaining balance of your order, the difference will be credited to the original payment method.

Note, for partial refunds on orders placed with the One\-time card Pay in 4 service, the service fee is still charged.

**Still haven’t received your refund after 14 days?**

Did you recently change banks or close your linked bank account? Have you canceled, temporarily frozen, blocked or changed your connected card?

If so, [log in](https://app.klarna.com/login) to let us know \- your refund may have bounced back to Klarna, causing the delay.

**Financing**

* If the total amount owed is greater than the refund, the refund will be deducted from the total balance of your financing account.
* If the total amount owed is less than the refund, the refund will be available as a positive balance in your Klarna account, allowing you to purchase again using your account at any participating online stores.

**Good to know:** Should the store’s return policy only allow refunds in the form of store credit, you are still responsible for your payments to Klarna associated with that purchase. According to the store’s T\&Cs express shipping fees are not refundable.
