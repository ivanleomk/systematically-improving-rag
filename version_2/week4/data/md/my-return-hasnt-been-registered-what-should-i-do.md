# My return hasn’t been registered, what should I do?

Only the store knows the status of your return and can adjust the total amount of your purchase. Because of this, we advise you to contact the store directly. Once the store has registered your return, your payment plan will be adjusted and you will receive an email and app notification. Potential repayments will be processed within 14 days. How your refund will be processed depends on the payment method used.

Submit the returns information at any time in the [app](https://app.klarna.com/login) – follow the prompts to enter the tracking details \& the date you made the return. If after 21 days your return is not registered correctly by the store we can always support you if you’ve provided the required returns information.

And always be sure to keep copies of your correspondence or proof of your attempts to contact the store.
