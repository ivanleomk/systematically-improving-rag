# What is a One-time card and how does it work?

The One\-time card service enables you to use Klarna payment options at any VISA card accepting online store in the US.

You can use the One\-time card service in the store’s checkout, like any regular credit card. Each One\-time card will follow a specific payment plan, which you can manage and pay in the app.

Please be aware that an authorization hold might be placed on your payment card when you use the One\-time card. This ensures that enough funds are available on your credit or debit card.

#### How to create a One\-time card

1. [**Log in**](https://login.klarna.com/login) **to shop with us**   
Choose Pay with Klarna or create a new One\-time card in the [app](https://login.klarna.com/login?market=GB&ui_locales=en-US#).
2. **Set the spending amount**  
Enter the exact amount, including shipping, that you plan to spend. After entering the amount, you will receive an overview of the agreement as confirmation. A flat service fee (or APR for longer payment plans) will be added to your purchase amount.
3. **Check out on the store’s site**  
When you’re ready to check out, your address details will be prefilled based on your information on file. If we don’t already have your information, you can enter your standard billing and shipping addresses.
4. **Pay with the One\-time card**  
When you are ready to pay, select the credit card option and enter the One\-time card information, as you would with any other card. Enter the card number, expiration date, and CVV code.
5. **Check the app or** [**log in**](https://login.klarna.com/login) **for updates**  
If you end up spending less than the amount on the One\-time card, you can change the spending amount by selecting **Refund unused amount** on the [purchase page](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/). Otherwise, the amount will automatically be adjusted after 14 days.

*Good to know:* You can only use a One\-time card once and, if unused, the card expires after 24 hours. If you want to make another purchase, just create a new card and keep on shopping.

#### Where can I use the One\-time card?

At any VISA card\-accepting online store in the US. Just search for your favorite store in the search bar, create a One\-time card and use it to checkout.

#### How do I pay for the purchases made with the One\-time card?

When you create a One\-time card it’s connected to your personal debit or credit card, depending on the payment option you chose. Your first payment is debited 24 hours after the card is created and the following payments are automatically withdrawn according to the payment plan. You can view your payment plan, pay early and change your connected debit or credit card at any time in the app.

#### When am I charged a service fee?

You are charged a service fee when you use a One\-time card to make bi\-weekly payments for a purchase on a non\-partner retailer that doesn’t have Klarna as a payment method. In addition, you are charged a service fee to pay by creating a gift card at certain merchants.
