# What happens after I‘ve reported my problem?

As soon as you’ve reported your problem your payment plan is paused. This gives you extra time to find a solution with the store.

If after 21 days you’re unable to find a resolution with the store, you will receive a request from us for additional information regarding your issue. Ensure to keep all relevant documentation. We can only support you if you provide us with the necessary information upon request.

**What happens next?**

After reviewing the information provided, we’ll notify you of the decision as soon as the investigation gets closed.

* **If the investigation is closed in your favor,** we’ll update your payment plan accordingly. In case you have paid too much we will refund any overpayments.
* **If we close the investigation in the store’s favor,** your original payments will still apply, but the payment schedule will be updated accordingly. This means that any outstanding payments will be due.

*Good to know:* The status of the investigation can be found on the [details page of your purchase](https://app.klarna.com/transactions/my-klarna/). If you’ve resolved the issue with the store after reporting your problem, you can easily update us by [logging in](https://app.klarna.com/).
