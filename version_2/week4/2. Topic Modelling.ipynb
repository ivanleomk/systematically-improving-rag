    "# Why Use Topic Modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large-scale RAG applications, understanding performance across different query types becomes challenging. Topic modeling helps solve this by automatically clustering similar queries, allowing us to efficiently identify patterns and potential issues in our system's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Bertopic because it provides a few benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has a modular architecture that allows us to swap out embedding models, clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques easily \n",
    "- It has built in visualisation and analysis tools\n",
    "- It offers a large amount of extensions that we can use to guide the model to generate topics that we care about\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use topic modelling here to identify clusters of related queries that we can then manually inspect. This allows us to understand how the queries we're getting differ from each other and come up with explicit categories for them. We would then validate these queries with a domain expert to ensure we're covering all the grounds that we need to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling is just a way to come up with these explicit categories."

    "# Generating Topics with BERTopic\n",

    "In this section, we'll walk you through how to generate topics from our dataset. In order to ensure our analysis is reproducible, we'll be fixing the random state of the `UMAP` algorithm as seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating Our Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to do so because the `UMAP` algorithm helps us to reduce our embeddings from a high dimensional space into a 2D space which we can then cluster using HDBSCAN. By ensuring that our embeddings are reduced consistently to the same form, we can ensure that our generated topics below are consistent. If we don't do so, then every time we run the BERTopic model, we'll generate slightly different results. \n",

As someone who's not very good with technology, this is proving to be quite a challenge for me, especially because I've been looking forward to using Klarna for some simple grocery shopping transactions. I followed the steps to try logging in using my email, but I never received the verification email or link, even though I checked every nook and cranny of my email, including the spam folder. I'm worried because I thought I was using the correct email address, but nothing seems to work. I also attempted to use my phone number, thinking perhaps it would be easier, but I still didn't receive any text with a verification code, despite checking the number twice. If it helps, I always end up confused when setting up these tech things and end up making mistakes. Could you possibly guide me step-by-step to resolve this issue? I read somewhere that I might need to do something with flight mode and resending the code, but I didn’t quite understand how it works. Your assistance would be much appreciated. Thank you very much for your patience with someone like me who isn't very tech-savvy.\n",

    "We want to look at our topics in closer detail to see if there are classes of queries that we're performing badly for. This helps us to understand how well we're nailing our search queries. To do so, we'll look at topics in terms of the query volume and the user satisfaction score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be generating user satisfaction scores synthetically for each topic so that we can see how well we're doing on each of them. Each query will be assigned a binary outcome of 1 or 0 representing whether the user was satisfied or not with the outcome determined by a random uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate the different combinations of query volume and satisfaction scores, we've chosen the following probabilities for each topic randomly. Once we've done so, we can start segmenting our queries into specific topics and see how well we're doing on those. This user satisfaction score is very important because it allows us to understand whether our system is able to retrieve relevant documents to answer our users' queries.\n",

    "Therefore, when it comes to building a real product, you should start collecting user satisfaction scores early so that you can use them to iteratively improve your system over time.\n"

    "1. Users are unhappy with recieving store credit and are asking to be given cash instead\n",
    "2. Users are in the process of having their refund process and are asking for updates or issues with their refund request\n",

    "4. The stores are not responding to their refund requests\n",
    "\n",
    "These are three very different types of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first one is difficult to solve programatically because stores have full control over their refund policy. Users might also be incredibly unhappy about the fact that they still need to pay off their purchase even though they've returned the items with the store credits. \n",
    "2. The second one is an issue of expectation mismatch - users expect a refund to be processed immediately but are unaware that it can take up to 14 days to process. This could perhaps be solved by adding a small disclaimer before users submit their refund requests.\n",
    "3. The third one is a straightforward issue that we can solve by perhaps adding a small FAQ/visual before users submit refund requests to help understand the impact of their refund on their payment schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, with this query segmentation and manually looking at our data, we can start to see where we might be able to improve our system to better answer user queries. We can also see that there is a single merchant - Nike that has a high volume of disatisfied queries. If this was happening on a consistent basis in a real product, we might want to look into why this is the case and see if there might be a deeper issue at play here."

    "# Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this short notebook, we've done a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We've generated topics from a dataset of user queries using BERTopic, identifying a few clusters of related queries that each revolved around a specific theme\n",
    "2. We took a deep dive into a specific topic that had a high volume of queries and a low satisfaction score. We did so by segmenting the queries in the topic by category and then sampling a few queries to understand the user intent. By doing so, we identified a few broad categories of user intents that were present within the topic itself\n",
    "3. We also covered how we might deploy and use this model in production to generate topics if we wanted to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll take a look at how we can classify user queries into these categories that we explicitly defined above. We'll look at how we can collaborate with domain experts by using a simple `.yaml` file which allows us to easily define new categories and reuse them in our prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of iteratively improving your RAG application is a crucial part of building a successful product. By understanding how to use topic modelling to identify clusters which we can then use to come up with explicit categories for your queries, you can start to see where your system might be lacking and improve it over time."
