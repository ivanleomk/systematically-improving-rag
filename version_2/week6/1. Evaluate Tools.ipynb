    "## Evaluating Tool Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to evaluate how well our model performs when it comes to calling tools. In order to do so, we'll be using two main metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Precision : Precision tells us what fraction of the tools we called were actualy useful. A high precision means we avoid wasting resources on calling irrelevant tools.\n",
    "2. Recall : Recall tells us what fraction of the relevant tools we actually used. A high recall means we're not missing important steps that the user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balancing these two metrics is critical. If we only focus on recall, the model might call too many toolsâ€”most of which are unnecessary. If we only focus on precision, then we might miss out on potential tools that the user needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand these concepts, we'll use a simple case study below of a personal assistant to see some of these concepts in action. We'll also cover some practical tips on how to improve our model's tool calling ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raycast Natural Language Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Raycast is an application which enables you to launch custom shortcuts and integrations on your computer. It combines a variety of different integrations with tools such as Jira, Airtable, Google among many others and will be launching an easy way to help prompt extensions with natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, given the command `@calendar when's my next meeting?`, Raycast will be able to execute a series of commands that you have installed which will fetch all of your meetings and then return your next meeting timing after the current time. This will allow users to be able to interact with their system quickly and effeciently. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook series, we'll look at how we might prototype a similar application. We'll do so over 3 notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evaluating Tool Calling ability**: Using a simple set of tools, we'll calculate precision and recall and see how to use these two metrics to evaluate the tools a model has called relative to a set of expected tool calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a Dataset** : We'll first examine some failure modes that models experience when it comes to tool calling and how we might generate a synthetic dataset to cover these failure cases. We'll then generate an initial set of queries that mimic these failure cases and then use them to generate a larger synthetic dataset of queries. While doing so, we'll use `braintrust` to evaluate the performance of our model's tool calling ability and establish an initial baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improvement** : Once we've done so, we'll explore different techniques that we can use to improve the performance of our model's tool calling ability such as few shot examples and system prompts provided by users. We'll then compare these against our original baseline and use the same techniques to evaluate the performance of our model."

    "2. **Tool Calling** : We'll then see how we can evalute the performance of our model using these metrics by writing simple assertions and unit tests\n",
    "3. **Parallel Tool Calling**: We'll then see how we can leverage parallel tool calling to improve the latency of our application and improve the performance of our model\n",

    "We can observe the following differences between the two methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Latency** : Parallel Tool Calling has a faster response time on average as compared to the baseline Tool Calling\n",
    "2. **Precision and Recall** : There's a 40% drop in precision and a ~60% drop in recall with parallel tool calling. This means that our model is not only calling tools that are less relevant to the user's query but also calling less tools in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the specific test cases above, we can see that when we switch over from tool calling to parallel tool calling, our model struggles with the following issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our model never calls the `CreateReminder` tool\n",
    "2. It struggles to call tools in combination with one another\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, if all of your tool calls are independent of each other and speed is your highest priority, you might choose parallel calling. Conversely, if you can afford a slightly longer response time, then tool calling might be a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having objective metrics that can measure the difference in performance between our two tool calling strategies, we can now iterate on the prompt, response model or even the specific language model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we looked at two meterics - Precision and Recall that we could use to evaluate our model's tool calling capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then used these metrics to evaluate the two different tool calling strategies - tool calling and parallel tool calling and talked a bit about how we might use the results to decide which one to go with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've built some intuition for how we might evaluate our model's tool calling capabilities, we'll start looking at how we can apply these metrics as we have more tools in our application drastically from 3 to ~70+ different tools."
